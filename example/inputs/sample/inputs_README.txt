OVERVIEW: This directory contains a bunch of pairs of node/edge csv input 
files. 

ADJACENCY MATRIX FILES:
Files following the naming convention edgemat_X.csv (where X is some integer)
can be used instead of the normal edges CSV file. These files are adjacency 
matrices where the columns map Node1 to NodeN and so do the rows.

LOBE FILES:
